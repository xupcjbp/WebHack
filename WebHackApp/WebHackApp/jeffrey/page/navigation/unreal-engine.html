				Actor is the base class for an Object that can be placed or spawned in a level.
				Actors may contain a collection of ActorComponents, which can be used to control how actors move, how they are rendered, etc.
				The other main function of an Actor is the replication of properties and function calls across the network during play.

		<div> <!-- HTML provides tags for code, variable, keyboard input, and program output; tag `pre` allows whitespace as is -->
			<p>Here is an example of a C++ function.</p>
<pre><code>void myFunc( int i ) {
    int localVar = i + 1;
}</code></pre>
<!-- tabs look weird by default on the browser; so I used 4 spaces in the code block above -->
			<p>In the function above, <var>localVar</var> is a local variable scoped in the function.</p>

			<p>Here is an example of bash command line.</p>
<pre><kbd>$ echo hello</kbd>
<samp>hello</samp></pre>
		</div> <!-- to be honest, I find this hard to use; <pre> tag makes HTML look ugly -->

		<!-- time and date notation is not always machine-friendly (different culture, languages ... etc); html defines a way to mark it -->
